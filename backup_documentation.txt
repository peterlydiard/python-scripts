**Purpose of Script:**

The purpose of the script is to perform incremental file backups from one or more source directories to a backup directory. This script is designed to provide users with a reliable and efficient way to create backups of important files while maintaining a record of these backups. It ensures that only new or modified files are backed up, reducing redundancy and saving storage space.

**Inputs and Outputs:**

**Inputs:**

1. **Source Directories:** Users specify one or more source directories from which files should be backed up. These directories contain the files that need to be protected.

2. **Backup Base Directory:** Users specify the backup base directory where the backups will be stored. This is the root location where all backup data will be organized.

3. **Excluded Directories:** Users can specify directories within the source directories that should be excluded from the backup. This allows for customization of which files should be backed up.

4. **Configuration File:** The script imports configuration data from an external Python file, `backup_config.py`, which contains information about source directories, the backup base directory, and excluded directories. This enhances script portability and flexibility.

**Outputs:**

1. **Backup Files:** The script creates backup copies of files from the source directories and stores them in a dated backup directory structure within the specified backup base directory. This ensures that each backup is organized by date and source directory.

2. **Backup Database:** For each backup, a database text file is generated. This file lists all the files included in the backup, showing their full paths in the source and backup folders. Additionally, it includes the MD5 hash of each file.

3. **Log File:** The script generates a log file, `backup_log.txt`, within the backup base directory. This file records the date the script was run and the number of files included in the backup on each date. It appends new information to the existing log if it already exists.

**General Operational Principles:**

1. **Hash Calculation:** The script calculates an MD5 hash for each file to identify whether it has been modified since the last backup. The hash includes the file path and data, making it unique even for identical files in different locations.

2. **Incremental Backup:** The script performs incremental backups, meaning it only copies files that have changed or are new since the last backup. This minimizes redundancy and speeds up the backup process.

3. **Exclusion of Directories:** Users can specify directories to exclude from the backup, allowing for customization based on specific requirements. This is useful for ignoring temporary or unnecessary files.

4. **Logging:** The script logs its activities to a log file, providing a historical record of backup operations. It includes the date and time of each backup, along with the number of files included.

5. **Error Handling:** The script checks the existence and permissions of source and backup directories, providing informative error messages to the terminal for any issues detected. It also checks write permissions for the backup directory.

**Options for Future Development (5 examples):**

1. **Scheduled Backups:** Implement a scheduling feature that allows users to automate backups at specified intervals, such as daily, weekly, or monthly.

2. **Encryption:** Add an option for encrypting backup files, providing an extra layer of security for sensitive data.

3. **Compression:** Integrate file compression to reduce the storage space required for backups. This can help save disk space and speed up transfer times for offsite backups.

4. **User Interface:** Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for the script, making it more accessible to users who are not comfortable with command-line interfaces.

5. **Selective Restoration:** Enhance the script to support selective restoration of files from backups, allowing users to choose which files or directories to restore, rather than restoring the entire backup.
